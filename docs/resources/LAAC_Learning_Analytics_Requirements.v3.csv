*Global aggregation rules:,,,,
• Score aggregation MUST consider only the highest-scoring attempt per learning element.,,,,
• Time aggregation MUST sum the durations of all attempts.,,,,
• All time values MUST be returned in seconds.,,,,
• All calculations MUST consider only entities the user is authorized to access.,,,,
