# SG-4-007 â€” Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall be directly deployable via Portainer with dev and prod Docker Compose setups, a Docker image, uniform and documented secrets handling, GitHub Actions CI/CD, and a webhook that triggers deployment.
- Rationale: Minimize developer effort; pushes to `main` should result in an automated, consistent deployment flow.
- Outcome: On push to `main`, a CI pipeline builds and pushes a container image, updates the target stack via a Portainer webhook/API, and uses a consistent secrets mechanism without storing secrets in the repo.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Docker image: A `Dockerfile` builds a runnable app image; image tags include commit SHA and `latest`.
  - Compose files: `docker-compose.dev.yml` (development) and `docker-compose.yml` (production) exist and are documented.
  - Secrets handling: Secrets provided via environment/Portainer secrets (or Docker/Swarm secrets); `.env.example` documents required variables; no secrets committed.
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow builds and pushes the image to a registry (e.g., GHCR) using repository secrets; upon success, it triggers a Portainer redeploy (webhook or API) for the target stack.
  - Documentation: README includes steps/URLs for Portainer webhook setup and variables required for dev/prod.
  - Verification: A successful pipeline run on `main` produces a new image and a redeploy event visible in Portainer.
- Priority: Medium
- Assumptions: Access to a container registry (e.g., GHCR), Portainer deployment with webhook/API enabled, and repository secrets configured for CI.
