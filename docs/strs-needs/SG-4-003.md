# SG-4-003 â€” Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall generate learning analytics from LRS data as specified in `docs/resources/LAAC_Learning_Analytics_Requirements.csv`, with support for metric evolution and new metric integration over time.
- Rationale: Required analytics are defined by collaborating developers and needed to develop and evaluate new algorithms. Requirements evolve as research progresses and new insights are needed.
- Outcome: For each metric defined in the CSV reference document, the system provides a computed result accessible to client systems (via API or service interface) using LRS data as the input source. New metrics can be added through a documented process.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Every metric listed in `docs/resources/LAAC_Learning_Analytics_Requirements.csv` is implemented and accessible.
  - Traceability exists from each CSV metric to its implementation and tests (via documentation or manifest).
  - Tests cover representative cases for each metric using sample LRS data.
  - Formal metric definitions exist in `docs/Metrics-Specification.md` with precise semantics.
  - Process documented for adding new metrics: update CSV, formalize in specification, implement computation, add tests, expose via versioned API.
  - Metric versioning strategy aligns with API versioning to track definition changes over time.
- Priority: High
- Assumptions: The target LRS exposes sufficient xAPI data to compute all listed metrics; CSV serves as the authoritative reference specification for required analytics, not as a runtime input; metric definitions are versioned alongside API versions.
