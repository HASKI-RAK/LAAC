# SG-4-001 â€” Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall act as an intermediary between client backends and an xAPI-compliant Learning Record Store (LRS).
- Rationale: Constrains scope and positions the system clearly as a mediation layer.
- Outcome: Client systems consume a unified API from this service; the service communicates with an xAPI-capable LRS for data access.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Exposes a client-facing API to consume analytics-related data and functions.
  - Integrates with an xAPI-compliant LRS via xAPI endpoints for querying/forwarding.
  - No non-xAPI data sources are required to fulfill core interactions.
- Priority: High
- Assumptions: Target LRS is xAPI-compliant; clients are backend services communicating over HTTP.
