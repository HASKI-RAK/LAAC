# SG-4-011 â€” Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall provide a versioned API with a clear versioning strategy and deprecation policy to manage breaking changes over time while maintaining backward compatibility for existing clients.
- Rationale: As the system evolves, new features and improvements may require API changes. A versioning strategy protects existing integrations while enabling innovation.
- Outcome: Clients can depend on stable API versions; breaking changes are introduced predictably with adequate notice and migration paths.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - API versioning scheme is documented and implemented (e.g., URI path versioning `/v1/`, `/v2/` or header-based versioning).
  - Each API version is independently documented with its own OpenAPI specification.
  - Deprecation policy specifies minimum support duration for deprecated versions (e.g., at least 6 months notice before removal).
  - Deprecated endpoints/versions return deprecation warnings in response headers (e.g., `Deprecation`, `Sunset` headers per RFC 8594).
  - Migration guides document breaking changes and provide examples for transitioning between versions.
  - At least one prior version is maintained during the deprecation period to allow gradual client migration.
  - Version information is included in API responses (e.g., `X-API-Version` header).
- Priority: High
- Assumptions: Major version increments indicate breaking changes; minor/patch versions maintain compatibility within a major version; the system starts with v1; versioning applies to all public client-facing endpoints.
