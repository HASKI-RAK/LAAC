# SG-4-008 â€” Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall have an extensible, understandable architecture adhering to good software principles (e.g., SOLID and CUPID), with well-maintained documentation (PlantUML diagrams and design documents) stored in the repository for use by both developers and GenAI assistants.
- Rationale: Enables easy implementation of new features; increases scalability, extensibility, and maintainability; improves team understanding and onboarding.
- Outcome: A dedicated architecture section in the repo provides up-to-date diagrams and design docs aligned with the NestJS module structure and conventions; changes to architecture are captured and traceable.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Repository includes an `docs/architecture/` folder with PlantUML diagrams (`.puml`) and accompanying design docs (overview, module boundaries, data flows, request lifecycles).
  - Architecture docs map to concrete modules/controllers/services and name the key extension points.
  - A brief guidance document explains SOLID and CUPID application in this codebase with examples/patterns to follow.
  - Documented steps to generate/preview diagrams locally (e.g., PlantUML CLI or VS Code plugin) and a script/command placeholder to validate diagrams (TODO if tooling not yet present).
  - Architecture docs are referenced from README and updated when significant changes are merged (policy stated).
- Priority: High
- Assumptions: NestJS module structure is the primary organizational unit; PlantUML is the chosen diagramming format; additional ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) may be used to capture key decisions.
