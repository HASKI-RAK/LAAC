# SG-4-005 â€” Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall provide well-documented API endpoints with built-in, discoverable API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger), describing available analytics, parameters, schemas, and responses.
- Rationale: External client developers must quickly understand which analytics are available and how to consume them reliably.
- Outcome: An interactive API documentation UI and machine-readable spec are generated from source annotations and published by the service.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - All public endpoints are annotated with descriptions, parameters, request/response schemas, and error codes.
  - A machine-readable OpenAPI specification is generated and served at a documented route.
  - An interactive documentation UI (e.g., Swagger UI) is accessible at a documented route and reflects the current API.
  - CI/test can fetch the OpenAPI JSON and validate basic structure (title/version/paths present).
- Priority: Medium
- Assumptions: NestJS Swagger decorators are used to generate OpenAPI; the documentation route is configurable and versioned with the API.
