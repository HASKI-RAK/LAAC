# SG-1-002 â€” Students

- Stakeholder Group: Students
- Need: Student-related data shall be deletable upon request (right to erasure), including derived analytics linked to the student identifier.
- Rationale: Data protection/privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR).
- Outcome: The system provides a controlled process to remove a student's data across storage, caches, and exposed APIs, with policy for logs and backups.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - A deletion operation exists (API or admin tool) that, given a student identifier, removes or irreversibly anonymizes associated data and computed metrics.
  - Caches and search indexes referencing the student are invalidated/purged.
  - API no longer returns data for the deleted student after completion.
  - Handling for logs/backups is documented: retention policy, exclusion of PII where feasible, and process for eventual purge where applicable.
  - An auditable record of the deletion request and completion is kept without storing PII (e.g., hashed ID, timestamp, operator).
  - Tests verify that post-deletion, queries for the student return no data and that caches are cleared.
- Priority: Low
- Assumptions: The system uses pseudonymous identifiers (see SG-1-001); some immutable logs/backups may have delayed purge subject to documented retention windows and legal constraints.
