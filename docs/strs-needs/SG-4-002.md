# SG-4-002 â€” Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall be deployable as a standalone service.
- Rationale: To allow easy deployment and maintenance.
- Priority: High
- Outcome: A single deployable unit that can be provisioned without external orchestration (beyond standard runtime and configuration).
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Container image builds and starts with documented `yarn run start:prod`.
  - Health/readiness endpoint responds successfully after startup.
  - Configuration via environment variables only (no secrets in repo).
  - Service is self-contained with only external dependency being the configured LRS endpoint(s) for querying xAPI data.
  - No additional microservices or distributed components required for core functionality.
- Assumptions: Runtime is Node.js; environment variables provide configuration; LRS availability is managed externally.
