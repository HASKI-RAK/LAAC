# SG-4-009 — Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: The system shall provide robust observability — structured logs, actionable metrics, and distributed tracing — to support debugging, performance tuning, and operations.
- Rationale: Effective troubleshooting and reliability require visibility into system behavior and performance.
- Outcome: Operators and developers can correlate requests (logs/traces), monitor SLIs via metrics, and detect/resolve issues quickly.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Logs: Structured, leveled logs with correlation/request IDs; no PII; errors include context; log volume configurable.
  - Metrics/telemetry: Emit structured events for key SLIs (e.g., request rate, error rate, latency percentiles, cache hit ratio) that can be ingested by log analytics platforms; tool agnostic so operators can add custom exporters if desired.
  - Dashboards/alerts: Documentation of baseline dashboards and alert conditions for critical SLIs, tool-agnostic with examples.
  - Tests: Minimal e2e or integration tests verify presence of correlation IDs, metric endpoints available, and trace context propagation through a request path.
- Priority: Medium
