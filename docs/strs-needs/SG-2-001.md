# SG-2-001 — Educators

- Stakeholder Group: Educators
- Need: Analytics data and results exposed by the system shall be accurate and verifiably correct.
- Rationale: Errors in analytics can lead to misguided decisions with significant consequences.
- Outcome: Computations match defined formulas/specs; results are reproducible and validated against trusted references and test fixtures.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Test coverage: Unit tests for every metric/computation; e2e tests validate API outputs using golden fixtures; coverage threshold documented (e.g., ≥ 85% lines/branches in analytics modules).
  - Reference validation: For a curated sample dataset, outputs match expected values within defined tolerances (if applicable) and include boundary cases.
  - Data quality checks: Input validation and integrity checks (e.g., required xAPI fields present; timestamp/order consistency) with clear error handling.
  - Determinism: Same inputs yield identical outputs; versioning of metric definitions to track changes over time.
  - Monitoring (optional/TODO): Basic runtime assertions or anomaly alerts for out-of-range values for critical metrics.
- Priority: Medium
- Assumptions: Metric definitions are unambiguous (see CSV/specs); minor floating-point tolerances are acceptable where documented.
