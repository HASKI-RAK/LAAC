# SG-1-001 â€” Students

- Stakeholder Group: Students
- Need: Student-related data shall be stored and exposed only in pseudonymized form (no clear names or direct identifiers).
- Rationale: Data protection/privacy; while the LRS covers parts of this, the system must ensure pseudonymization in storage, processing, logs, and API responses.
- Outcome: All analytics and APIs use stable pseudonymous identifiers; no direct personal identifiers are stored or emitted by default.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - No clear names, emails, or direct identifiers in databases, caches, logs, or API responses.
  - Documented pseudonymization strategy (e.g., salted hash or surrogate keys) with secure handling of any mapping keys outside the code repo.
  - API contracts expose only pseudonymous IDs; documentation reflects this.
  - Tests verify that ingest, processing, and API output contain no PII for sample inputs.
  - Compliance notes reference GDPR principles for data minimization and pseudonymization.
- Priority: Medium
- Assumptions: LRS provides subject identifiers; mapping secrets/salts are provided via environment/secret store; re-identification (if required) is restricted and out of scope for public APIs.
