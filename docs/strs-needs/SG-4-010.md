# SG-4-010 — Developers

- Stakeholder Group: Developers
- Need: Client requests to analytics endpoints shall complete within 1 second end-to-end under normal operating conditions.
- Rationale: Ensures responsive integrations and good UX; avoids client timeouts and enables interactive usage.
- Outcome: The service consistently meets a defined latency objective for read/analytics endpoints.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - SLO: For read/analytics endpoints, p95 end-to-end latency ≤ 1s under a documented nominal load profile and dataset size; p50 ≤ 500ms (target). Cache hits should typically be faster than misses.
  - Load profile (TODO): Document expected concurrent users/QPS and representative dataset sizes to qualify “normal conditions”.
  - Cold start/first-run (TODO): Define allowances for initial warm-up; subsequent requests must meet SLO.
  - Measurement: Latency histograms exported via metrics; e2e performance test can verify SLO in a controlled environment.
  - Degradations: When SLO cannot be met (e.g., external LRS slowness), system surfaces appropriate status/telemetry and avoids cascading failures (e.g., timeouts, retries with backoff).
- Priority: Medium
- Assumptions: Network to LRS is reliable with typical latency budget; heavy computations can leverage caching (see SG-4-004) or precomputation where needed.
