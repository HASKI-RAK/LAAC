# SG-5-001 â€” Regulatory Bodies

- Stakeholder Group: Regulatory Bodies
- Need: The system shall enforce a security baseline covering authentication, authorization, secure data handling, and operational security.
- Rationale: Compliance and risk mitigation require controlled access, protection of data in transit/at rest, and secure operations.
- Outcome: Only authorized parties access data/functions with least privilege; data is protected; security posture is testable and auditable.
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Authentication: All non-public endpoints require authenticated access using industry-standard mechanisms (protocol-agnostic).
  - Authorization: Role/scope-based access control enforces least privilege for analytics and admin functions; access rules are documented and test-covered.
  - Data protection:
    - In transit: TLS is required for external communication; internal policies documented for service-to-service encryption.
    - At rest: Sensitive data (including caches where applicable) is protected according to documented policy (e.g., encryption or minimization/pseudonymization).
  - Secrets management: Secrets are never committed; provided via environment/secret store; rotation process documented.
  - Secure defaults: Input validation, rate limiting/throttling policy, and error handling avoid leaking sensitive information.
  - Supply chain: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning is configured (tool-agnostic); critical issues are triaged.
  - Auditability: Security-relevant events (auth failures, admin actions) are logged with privacy in mind; logs are retainable and reviewable.
  - Testing: Security-related tests/checks run in CI (lint/policy checks, minimal e2e authz tests) without mandating a specific tool.
- Priority: High
- Assumptions: Organization will choose concrete auth providers, certificate management, and scanning tools; policies align with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR).
