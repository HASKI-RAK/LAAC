## Description
The system shall provide a `Dockerfile` that builds a production-ready container image. Images shall be tagged with `latest`, and pushed to a container registry (e.g., GitHub Container Registry) as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Rationale
Enables consistent, reproducible deployments and supports rollback to specific versions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `Dockerfile` exists at the repository root and successfully builds the application.
- The image includes all runtime dependencies and is optimized (multi-stage build, minimal base image).
- CI builds and tags images with: `<registry>/<name>:<commit-sha>` and `<registry>/<name>:latest`.
- Images are pushed to a configured container registry (e.g., GHCR) using repository secrets for authentication.
- The image passes a smoke test (e.g., `docker run <image> --version` or health check endpoint responds).

## Verification
- CI job builds the image and confirms successful push to registry.
- Manual pull and run of the image confirms it starts and serves requests.
- Multi-stage build reduces image size compared to naive builds.

## Dependencies
- REQ-NF-002 (standalone deployability) for runtime packaging.

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Base image is Node.js LTS or Alpine-based for minimal footprint.
- Registry credentials are provided via CI secrets.

## API/Interface Impact
- None directly; supports deployment infrastructure.

## Observability
- CI logs include image build summary and pushed tags.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
