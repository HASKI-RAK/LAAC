## Description
The system shall provide a clear, stable extension architecture for adding new analytics metrics, including well-defined interfaces (e.g., `Metric` interface or abstract class), a registry or factory for metric discovery, and integration with NestJS dependency injection.

## Rationale
Enables rapid addition of new metrics with minimal code coupling and predictable integration points.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A metric registry or factory auto-discovers and registers metrics (e.g., via NestJS providers or a decorator-based pattern).
- New metrics are added by implementing the interface and registering in a module; no changes to core routing or controller logic required.
- SOLID / CUPID principles.
- Architecture documentation (e.g., PlantUML diagrams) illustrates the metric lifecycle and extension points.

## Verification
- Unit tests for the registry/factory confirm auto-discovery of test metrics.
- Integration tests add a mock metric and verify it's accessible via the API without modifying controllers.
- Architecture review confirms adherence to SOLID principles (especially Open/Closed).

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-001 (client-facing API), REQ-FN-002 (LRS integration), REQ-FN-003 (catalog).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- NestJS module and DI conventions are followed.
- Metrics are stateless; any state is managed via cache or external services.

## API/Interface Impact
- Internal: `Metric` interface, registry, and module structure.
- External: New metrics appear in catalog and results endpoints automatically.

## Observability
- Logs show discovered metrics at startup (count and IDs).

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
