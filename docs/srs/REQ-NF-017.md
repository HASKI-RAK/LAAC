## Description
Analytics endpoints shall meet specific latency service level objectives (SLOs) under documented nominal load and dataset conditions, ensuring responsive client integrations.

## Rationale
Defines the performance contract with clients and enables validation of service responsiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- SLO targets for read/analytics endpoints:
  - P95 latency ≤ 1s end-to-end (warm cache)
  - P50 latency ≤ 500ms end-to-end (warm cache)
  - P95 latency ≤ 2s for cold cache scenarios
  - Cache hits are measurably faster than cache misses (≥3× improvement per REQ-NF-006)
- Nominal load profile:
  - Peak: 20 concurrent students
  - Typical: 1-2 parallel requests
  - Single-instance deployment (vertical scaling only)
- Nominal dataset size:
  - ≤20 active students
  - ≤10 courses
  - Typical xAPI statement volume per student per course (~hundreds to low thousands of statements)
- Cold start allowance: Initial warm-up is permitted; SLO applies to steady-state operation
- Latency measurement: End-to-end from client request to response, measured server-side (excludes network to client)
- SLO monitoring: Latency histograms exported via metrics (REQ-FN-021) with percentile aggregation

## Verification
- Performance tests (REQ-FN-022) validate SLO compliance under nominal conditions
- Metrics dashboards track actual P50/P95 latencies in production
- Load tests confirm system meets SLO at documented load profile

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-006 (caching) to achieve latency targets
- REQ-FN-021 (metrics export) for latency monitoring
- REQ-FN-022 (performance testing)

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Network to LRS is reliable with typical latency budget (<100ms)
- Vertical scaling (CPU/memory) is available as needed
- No horizontal scaling required for nominal load

## Observability
- Latency percentiles (P50, P90, P95, P99) exported via metrics endpoint
- Alerts trigger when P95 exceeds SLO threshold for sustained period

## Risks / Open Questions
- External LRS slowness may degrade performance; tracked via LRS query latency metrics
