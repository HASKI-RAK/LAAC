## Description
The system shall require authentication for all non-public endpoints and enforce role/scope-based authorization to control access to analytics and administrative functions according to the principle of least privilege.

## Rationale
Protects sensitive analytics data and administrative functions from unauthorized access.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Authentication:
  - All endpoints except health, metrics, and public documentation require authentication
  - Supports industry-standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth2, API keys) - protocol-agnostic, configurable
  - Authentication configuration is provided via environment variables
  - Failed authentication attempts return HTTP 401 with appropriate headers (e.g., `WWW-Authenticate`)
- Authorization:
  - Role/scope-based access control enforced for:
    - Analytics read endpoints: require `analytics:read` scope/role
    - Cache invalidation: require `admin:cache` scope/role
    - Instance configuration: require `admin:config` scope/role
  - Access rules are documented in `docs/security.md` with role definitions and endpoint mappings
  - Failed authorization attempts return HTTP 403 with explanatory message (no sensitive data leakage)
- Token/credential validation:
  - Expired or invalid tokens are rejected
  - Token introspection or validation is performed on each request or with short-lived caching
- Bypass mechanisms:
  - Authentication can be disabled for dev/test environments via `AUTH_ENABLED=false` (default: true)

## Verification
- E2E tests verify:
  - Unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints return 401
  - Authenticated requests without required scope/role return 403
  - Valid credentials with appropriate scope succeed
- Integration tests with mock auth provider confirm token validation logic
- Security tests attempt to bypass authorization and verify failures

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-014 (secrets management) for auth credentials/keys
- REQ-NF-019 (security baseline)

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Choice of auth provider (e.g., Keycloak, Auth0, custom JWT issuer) is deployment-specific
- Public endpoints (health, metrics, docs) remain unauthenticated to support monitoring and discovery

## API/Interface Impact
- Protected endpoints require `Authorization` header (e.g., `Bearer <token>` or `X-API-Key: <key>`)
- 401/403 responses include appropriate headers and error details

## Observability
- Authentication failures logged with: timestamp, attempted endpoint, reason (expired, invalid, missing)
- Authorization failures logged with: user/subject, endpoint, required scope, actual scope
- No sensitive tokens or passwords logged

## Risks / Open Questions
- Need to define supported auth mechanisms and configuration examples in documentation
