## Description
The system shall generate and expose a machine-readable OpenAPI (v3.x) specification documenting all public API endpoints, request/response schemas, parameters, and error codes. The specification shall be generated from source code annotations (e.g., NestJS Swagger decorators).

## Rationale
Enables client developers to integrate reliably and supports tooling (code generation, contract testing, client SDKs).

## Acceptance Criteria
- All public endpoints (controllers) are annotated with OpenAPI decorators describing operations, parameters, request bodies, and responses.
- A valid OpenAPI 3.x JSON/YAML specification is generated at build or runtime.
- The specification is served at a documented route (e.g., `/api-docs/openapi.json` or `/api/v1/openapi.json`).
- Specification includes API metadata: title, version, description, contact/license info.
- CI can fetch and validate the OpenAPI spec (e.g., using openapi-validator or spectral).

## Verification
- Unit/integration tests verify presence of key OpenAPI decorators on representative controllers.
- CI job fetches the spec endpoint and validates structure (paths, components, info fields present).
- Manual review confirms spec completeness for a sample of endpoints.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-001 (client-facing API).
- All endpoint requirements (REQ-FN-003, REQ-FN-005, etc.).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- NestJS Swagger module is used for annotation and generation.
- OpenAPI version ≥ 3.0 (3.1 if supported).

## API/Interface Impact
- Introduces endpoint: GET /api-docs/openapi.json (or similar, documented in README).

## Observability
- Logs confirm OpenAPI module initialization at startup.

## Risks / Open Questions
- Keeping annotations in sync with implementation requires discipline; CI validation helps enforce.
