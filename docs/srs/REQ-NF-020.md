## Description
The system shall include security-related tests and checks that run in CI to validate authentication, authorization, input validation, and secure configuration, ensuring security requirements are continuously verified.

## Rationale
Automated security testing detects regressions and ensures security controls remain effective.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CI security checks:
  - Secret scanning (no committed secrets)
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning (npm audit or equivalent)
  - Linter rules for security patterns (e.g., ESLint security plugins)
- Automated tests:
  - Unit tests for input validation (DTO validation with malicious inputs)
  - E2E tests for authentication (unauthenticated requests rejected)
  - E2E tests for authorization (insufficient privileges rejected)
  - Rate limiting tests (requests beyond threshold rejected)
- Security test coverage:
  - At least 80% of protected endpoints have auth/authz test coverage
  - Critical security functions (auth, validation, rate limiting) have dedicated test suites
- Compliance validation:
  - Security checklist documented in `docs/security.md` for manual review
  - CI reports security test results and blocks merges on critical failures
  - Quarterly security review process documented

## Verification
- CI pipeline includes security test stage and reports results
- Code coverage reports include security-related test paths
- Manual review confirms security checklist items are testable/auditable

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-023 (authentication/authorization)
- REQ-FN-024 (input validation/rate limiting)
- REQ-NF-019 (security baseline)

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Security testing is automated where possible; manual penetration testing is out of scope for this requirement
- Tool-agnostic approach; specific tools chosen by team

## Observability
- CI logs show security test execution and results
- Metrics track security test pass/fail rates over time

## Risks / Open Questions
- Need to define security test coverage targets and review cadence
