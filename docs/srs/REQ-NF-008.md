## Description
API documentation shall be complete, accurate, and synchronized with the implementation, covering all public endpoints, parameters, schemas, and error responses without omissions or outdated information.

## Rationale
Incomplete or inaccurate documentation undermines developer trust and integration success.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All public endpoints have OpenAPI annotations for operations, parameters, request/response bodies, and common error codes (400, 401, 404, 500).
- Schemas (DTOs) are documented with property descriptions and validation constraints where applicable.
- CI validation fails if the OpenAPI spec is invalid or missing required metadata (title, version, paths).
- Documentation versioning aligns with API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1` endpoints documented under v1 spec).
- No endpoints are accessible in production that are undocumented in the OpenAPI spec.

## Verification
- CI job runs OpenAPI linter/validator (e.g., spectral, openapi-validator) and enforces coverage rules.
- Code review checklist includes OpenAPI annotation verification for new endpoints.
- E2E tests confirm documented endpoints match implemented routes.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-008, REQ-FN-009.

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Documentation is generated from code; manual docs are minimized to reduce drift.

## Observability
- CI reports on documentation coverage and validation results.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
