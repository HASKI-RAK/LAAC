## Description
Cached analytics results shall remain consistent with the authoritative LRS data, ensuring clients never receive stale or incorrect results beyond configurable staleness bounds (TTL).

## Rationale
Cache effectiveness must not compromise data accuracy or violate client expectations for freshness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cached results match fresh computations when LRS data has not changed.
- Staleness is bounded by documented TTL values; no unbounded caching without expiry.
- If a cache entry is served, its age (time since generation) is included in response metadata for client visibility.
- Tests verify cache correctness: invalidation on data change (or TTL expiry), and no incorrect results due to key collisions or stale entries.

## Verification
- Unit tests for cache key uniqueness and collision prevention.
- E2E tests confirm cache invalidation triggers (TTL, manual, data version) prevent stale results.
- Contract tests validate response metadata includes cache age/timestamp.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-006, REQ-FN-007.
- REQ-NF-004 (determinism and consistency).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- "Stale" is defined relative to TTL or LRS data version; exact real-time consistency is not required.

## Observability
- Alerts trigger if cache age exceeds documented maximum or if invalidation failures are detected.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
