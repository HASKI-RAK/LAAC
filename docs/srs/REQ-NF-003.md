## Description
The system shall maintain traceability from the CSV reference specification (`LAAC_Learning_Analytics_Requirements.csv`) to implemented metrics, ensuring complete coverage. A verification mechanism (documentation, manifest, or automated check) shall confirm that all CSV-specified metrics are implemented and tested.

## Rationale
Ensures the implemented catalog and computations fully cover the authoritative CSV specification and supports maintainable evolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A traceability mapping exists (e.g., documentation section, manifest file, or code comments) linking CSV rows to metric identifiers and test cases.
- CI or documentation review process verifies that all CSV-specified metrics have corresponding implementations and tests.
- When new metrics are added to the CSV, the verification process identifies them as unimplemented until code is added.

## Verification
- CI job/script or manual review checklist confirms CSV and implementation are in sync.
- Documentation includes a metrics coverage table or automated report.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-003 (catalog), REQ-FN-004 (computations).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- The CSV is a reference document; changes require corresponding code updates.
- Required CSV columns: `Dashboard Level`, `Metric Description`, `Source`.

## Observability
- Build or CI logs show metrics coverage status.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
