title: CSV Schema Validation and Traceability

## Description
The system shall validate the `LAAC_Learning_Analytics_Requirements.csv` at startup and build time for required columns and well-formed values. Each metric shall be traceable from CSV to implementation and tests via a stable identifier.

## Rationale
Ensures the catalog reliably reflects the authoritative CSV and supports maintainable evolution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CSV validation fails fast with clear errors when required columns are missing or contain empty/invalid values.
- A traceability mapping exists (e.g., generated manifest file or code map) from CSV rows to metric identifiers and test cases.
- CI fails if the CSV changes in a way that breaks validation or unimplemented metrics are introduced.

## Verification
- Unit tests for CSV validator with positive and negative samples.
- CI job/script checks CSV validity and presence of corresponding implementations/tests.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-003 (catalog generation).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Required columns: `Dashboard Level`, `Metric Description`, `Source`.

## Observability
- Validation results are logged at startup, including counts of metrics and any warnings.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
