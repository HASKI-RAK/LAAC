title: Graceful Degradation and Timeout Handling

## Description
The system shall gracefully degrade when latency SLOs cannot be met (e.g., due to external LRS slowness), surfacing appropriate status and telemetry while avoiding cascading failures.

## Rationale
Ensures system remains stable and provides useful feedback when performance degrades due to external factors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Timeout configuration: All outbound LRS queries have configurable timeouts (default: 5s for queries, 10s for large result sets)
- Timeout handling:
  - Timeouts are logged with context (LRS endpoint, query, timeout threshold)
  - Metrics track timeout rate per LRS instance
  - Client receives appropriate error response (HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout or 503 Service Unavailable) with explanatory message
- Retry logic:
  - Transient LRS failures trigger retries with exponential backoff (max 2 retries)
  - Non-retryable errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request from LRS) fail fast without retries
- Circuit breaker (optional, future enhancement):
  - If LRS error rate exceeds threshold, temporarily fail fast to avoid cascading delays
  - Documented as TODO if not implemented initially
- Response headers include diagnostic hints when degraded:
  - `X-Performance-Status: degraded` when response time exceeds SLO but succeeds
  - `Retry-After` header for 503 responses suggesting client retry interval
- No cascading failures: Slow LRS queries do not block other requests or exhaust connection pools

## Verification
- Fault injection tests simulate LRS slowness/timeouts and verify:
  - Timeouts trigger after configured threshold
  - Retries occur with backoff
  - Error responses are well-formed
  - Other requests remain unaffected
- Load tests with degraded LRS confirm no cascading failures
- Metrics confirm timeout/error rates are tracked

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-002 (LRS integration) for query timeout configuration
- REQ-FN-020 (logging) for timeout context logging

## Assumptions / Constraints
- LRS timeout thresholds are configurable via environment variables
- Default timeouts are conservative; may need tuning based on LRS performance

## Observability
- Metrics track LRS query timeouts and retry rates
- Logs include timeout events with full context
- Alerts trigger on sustained high timeout rates

## Risks / Open Questions
- Define appropriate timeout values based on actual LRS performance; document in configuration guide
