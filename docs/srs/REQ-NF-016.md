## Description
The system shall provide documentation of baseline observability dashboards and alert conditions for critical SLIs, tool-agnostic with examples for common monitoring platforms.

## Rationale
Guides operators in setting up effective monitoring and alerting without prescribing specific tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A `docs/observability.md` (or similar) document exists with:
  - List of critical SLIs and recommended thresholds:
    - Request error rate > 5% for 5 minutes
    - P95 latency > 2s for analytics endpoints
    - Cache hit ratio < 30% (may indicate misconfiguration or cold cache)
    - LRS query error rate > 10%
    - Health check failures
  - Example dashboard panels (described textually or with JSON/YAML snippets) for Prometheus/Grafana
  - Example alert rules (PromQL or similar) for critical conditions
  - Guidance on correlation ID usage for troubleshooting
- README links to observability documentation
- Baseline thresholds are informed by performance requirements (REQ-NF-005, REQ-NF-006) and operational experience

## Verification
- Manual review confirms documentation completeness
- Example Prometheus scrape config and alert rules are syntactically valid
- Observability guide is referenced during deployment setup

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-020 (logging)
- REQ-FN-021 (metrics)
- REQ-NF-005 (performance SLO)

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Tool-agnostic approach; examples provided for Prometheus/Grafana but adaptable to other platforms
- Thresholds are starting points and may need tuning based on actual usage

## Observability
- None directly; guides observability setup

## Risks / Open Questions
- None
