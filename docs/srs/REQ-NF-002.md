## Description
The system shall be deployable as a standalone service, starting and running as a single deployable unit with externally provided configuration, without requiring tight coupling to a specific orchestration platform.


## Rationale
Facilitates straightforward deployment and operations across environments.


## Acceptance Criteria
- Start/Run: A documented command starts the service in production mode and keeps it running (e.g., process manager or container entrypoint).
- Configuration: All runtime configuration is provided via environment variables or mounted secrets; a `.env.example` (or docs) lists required variables.
- Health: A health/readiness endpoint indicates when the service is operational.
- Logs: Service emits structured logs to stdout/stderr suitable for capture by the hosting environment.
- Packaging: A single deployable artifact exists (e.g., container image or package) that can be run with minimal external dependencies.
- Documentation: README includes minimal steps to configure and run the service in prod mode.


## Verification
- Manual or scripted start in a clean environment using only documented steps and env vars.
- Health endpoint responds successfully after startup; logs show successful initialization.
- Lint/check: CI verifies presence of `.env.example` (or equivalent docs) and the health endpoint route.


## Dependencies
- None specific; complements CI/CD and Portainer deployment requirements (see SG-4-007 derived REQ).


## Assumptions / Constraints
- Hosting environment provides a standard runtime (e.g., Node.js/container) and a way to inject environment variables and secrets.


## API/Interface Impact
- Introduces a health/readiness endpoint route.


## Observability
- Startup logs include configuration sanity (non-secret) and health readiness transition.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None yet.
