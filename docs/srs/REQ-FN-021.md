## Description
The system shall expose service metrics for key SLIs (request rate, error rate, latency percentiles, cache hit ratio) via a metrics endpoint in a format compatible with standard monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/OpenMetrics).

## Rationale
Provides quantitative insights into system health and performance for monitoring and alerting.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A metrics endpoint exists at a documented route (e.g., `/metrics` or `/api/metrics`) exposing metrics in Prometheus/OpenMetrics format
- Key metrics exported include:
  - HTTP request rate (requests/sec) by endpoint and status code
  - HTTP request latency (histogram with percentiles: P50, P90, P95, P99) by endpoint
  - HTTP error rate (4xx, 5xx) by endpoint
  - Cache hit/miss rates by metric ID (if caching enabled per REQ-FN-006)
  - LRS query latency and error rate
  - Active requests (gauge)
- Metrics include labels/tags for: `endpoint`, `method`, `status`, `metricId`, `instanceId` (if multi-instance)
- Metrics endpoint is not authenticated (or uses basic auth if configured) to allow scraping by monitoring tools
- Documentation (README or observability guide) lists all exported metrics with descriptions

## Verification
- E2E tests confirm metrics endpoint is accessible and returns valid Prometheus format
- Load test or manual requests verify metrics are updated (counters increment, histograms populate)
- Validation: Prometheus scrape config example successfully scrapes the endpoint

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-006 (caching) for cache metrics
- REQ-FN-002 (LRS integration) for LRS query metrics

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Metrics format is Prometheus/OpenMetrics-compatible but does not prescribe a specific monitoring backend
- Metrics endpoint does not expose PII

## API/Interface Impact
- Introduces endpoint: GET /metrics (or similar, documented in README)

## Observability
- Metrics themselves are the primary observability artifact

## Risks / Open Questions
- Metrics cardinality (number of unique label combinations) should be monitored to avoid explosion; avoid high-cardinality labels (e.g., student IDs)
