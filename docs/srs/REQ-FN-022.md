## Description
The system shall include automated performance tests that validate latency SLOs for analytics endpoints under documented nominal load profiles and dataset sizes.

## Rationale
Ensures the service meets latency objectives and detects performance regressions during development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Performance test suite exists (e.g., using k6, Artillery, or similar) covering:
  - Representative analytics endpoints (catalog, single metric results, batch results)
  - Nominal load profile: simulating 20 concurrent students with 1-2 parallel requests
  - Representative dataset: ~20 students × ~10 courses with typical xAPI statement volume
- Tests measure and report:
  - P50, P95, P99 latency for each endpoint
  - Request success rate
  - Cache hit ratio (if caching enabled)
- Tests validate SLO targets:
  - P95 ≤ 1s for warm cache
  - P50 ≤ 500ms for warm cache
  - P95 ≤ 2s for cold cache scenarios
- Tests can be run in CI (on schedule or manually triggered) or locally
- Results are exported in machine-readable format (JSON, CSV) for tracking over time
- Documentation (`docs/performance.md` or README) describes how to run tests and interpret results

## Verification
- Manual execution of performance tests confirms they run and produce valid results
- CI integration confirms tests can be automated
- Results validation: spot-check that reported latencies align with SLO targets

## Dependencies
- REQ-NF-005 (analytics endpoint performance SLO)
- REQ-FN-021 (metrics export) for latency histograms

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Tests use mock or seeded LRS data to ensure repeatability
- Performance baselines assume single-instance deployment (no horizontal scaling)

## API/Interface Impact
- None directly; tests exercise existing endpoints

## Observability
- Test results include performance metrics and SLO pass/fail status

## Risks / Open Questions
- Test environment should approximate production resource limits; document resource requirements
