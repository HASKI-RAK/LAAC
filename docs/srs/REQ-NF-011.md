## Description
Deployment via CI/CD shall be automated, reliable, and require no manual intervention for standard updates to `main`, with clear success/failure feedback.

## Rationale
Minimizes developer toil and ensures predictable delivery.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A push to `main` that passes tests results in a deployed update within 10 minutes (build + push + redeploy).
- Deployment success rate ≥ 95% for changes that pass CI tests (failures due to infrastructure, not code).
- Failed deployments provide actionable logs and do not leave the system in a broken state (previous version continues running or health checks fail gracefully).
- README or runbook documents manual rollback steps if automation fails.

## Verification
- Measure deployment latency and success rate over initial deployments (e.g., first 10 releases).
- Test failure scenarios (e.g., Portainer webhook timeout) and confirm graceful handling.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-015 (CI/CD pipeline).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Portainer and registry are operationally stable; SLAs assumed.

## Observability
- CI/CD metrics (build time, deployment time, success/failure rate) are tracked.
- Alerts on deployment failure.

## Risks / Open Questions
- Webhook failures may require retry logic or fallback to manual trigger.
