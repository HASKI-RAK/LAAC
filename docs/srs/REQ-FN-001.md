## Description
The system shall expose a client-facing API that serves as the primary integration point for external backends to consume learning analytics and related data. The API abstracts the underlying LRS and does not require clients to access the LRS directly.


## Rationale
Implements the intermediary role for clients, enabling a clear boundary and decoupling from the LRS.


## Acceptance Criteria
- Public endpoints exist to retrieve analytics derived from LRS data.
- API surface is cohesive and does not leak LRS credentials or internal endpoints.
- Error responses are well-defined and consistent across endpoints.


## Verification
- E2E tests call representative API endpoints and receive valid responses based on seeded/mock LRS data.
- Contract tests validate request/response shapes for the main endpoints.


## Dependencies
- Depends on LRS integration capability (see REQ-FN-002).
- Documentation generation tracked separately (see SG-4-005 derived REQ).


## Assumptions / Constraints
- Clients are backend services calling over HTTP.


## API/Interface Impact
- Defines the external interface consumed by client systems.


## Observability
- Requests include correlation IDs and are logged at appropriate levels (see observability REQ).

## Risks / Open Questions
- None yet.
