## Description
The caching subsystem shall achieve measurable performance improvements and maintain cache hit ratios suitable for reducing LRS load and client latency.

## Rationale
Quantifies the value of caching and ensures it delivers the expected benefits.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Cache hits are at least 3× faster than equivalent recomputation under representative workloads (measured server-side, excluding network).
- Target cache hit ratio ≥ 40% under typical access patterns (repeated dashboard views, student analytics).
- Cache hit/miss metrics are exported and monitored in observability dashboards.

## Verification
- Performance benchmarks compare cached vs. uncached request latencies.
- CI or staging tests with realistic request patterns measure hit ratios and validate targets.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-006 (caching), REQ-FN-007 (invalidation).
- REQ-NF-005 (performance SLO for analytics endpoints).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- "Representative workload" is defined as a mix of student-scoped and course-scoped queries with some temporal overlap; evolves as usage patterns are observed.

## Observability
- Dashboards show cache hit/miss rates, latency distributions for hits vs. misses, and cache storage utilization.

## Risks / Open Questions
- Initial hit ratios may be lower until access patterns stabilize; targets are iterative.
