title: xAPI LRS Integration

## Description
The system shall integrate with an xAPI-compliant Learning Record Store (LRS) to query and retrieve data necessary for analytics, using the LRS’s xAPI endpoints and supported auth mechanisms.


## Rationale
Fulfills the mediator role by sourcing all analytics input from an xAPI-capable LRS.


## Acceptance Criteria
- Connectivity to a configured xAPI-compliant LRS is established using environment-provided configuration (URL, auth, etc.).
- The system can perform representative xAPI queries required to compute analytics (e.g., statements within time ranges, filtered by actor/object).
- Failures from the LRS are handled gracefully with informative error mapping to the client-facing API.


## Verification
- Integration tests run against a mock/test LRS endpoint covering authentication and common query patterns.
- Configuration validation tests ensure required env vars are present and well-formed.


## Dependencies
- Works in concert with the client-facing API (REQ-FN-001) and analytics computation requirements.


## Assumptions / Constraints
- The LRS is xAPI-compliant and exposes endpoints sufficient for required analytics.
- No direct database access to the LRS backend is assumed.


## API/Interface Impact
- Internal adapters/gateways to LRS; no direct exposure to clients.


## Observability
- Outbound LRS calls are traced and metered for latency and error rates.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None yet.
