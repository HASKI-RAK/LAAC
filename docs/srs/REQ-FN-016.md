## Description
The system shall implement a versioned API with explicit version identifiers, supporting multiple concurrent API versions during deprecation periods, and providing clear deprecation notices to clients.

## Rationale
Enables safe evolution of the API while protecting existing client integrations from breaking changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- API endpoints include version identifier in the URI path (e.g., `/api/v1/metrics`, `/api/v2/metrics`).
- Each major version has its own OpenAPI specification document served at `/api/v{N}/openapi.json`.
- Current API version is exposed via response header `X-API-Version` on all responses.
- Deprecated versions return additional headers:
  - `Deprecation: true` (per draft RFC)
  - `Sunset: <HTTP-date>` indicating planned removal date (RFC 8594)
  - `Link: <URL>; rel="alternate"` pointing to migration guide
- At least one prior major version is maintained for minimum 6 months after deprecation announcement.
- Migration guides exist in `docs/api-migrations/` documenting changes between versions with code examples.
- CI tests validate that multiple versions can coexist and respond correctly.
- Default/unversioned routes (e.g., `/api/metrics`) redirect or proxy to latest stable version with appropriate headers.

## Verification
- E2E tests call endpoints with different version paths and verify correct behavior per version.
- Tests verify deprecation headers are present for deprecated versions.
- Documentation review confirms migration guides exist for each version transition.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-008 (OpenAPI specification generation)
- REQ-FN-001 (Client-facing API)

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Versioning follows semantic versioning principles: major version for breaking changes, minor/patch for compatible changes.
- Initial release is v1; pre-release versions (v0) are considered unstable.
- Version selection is URI-based for simplicity and caching; header-based versioning is not used.

## API/Interface Impact
- Defines the API structure: `/api/v1/*`, `/api/v2/*`, etc.
- All client integrations must specify target version in URI.

## Observability
- Metrics track API usage per version to inform deprecation decisions.
- Logs include API version for all requests.

## Risks / Open Questions
- Need to define process for announcing deprecations (release notes, changelog, client notifications).
