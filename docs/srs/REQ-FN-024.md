## Description
The system shall validate all input data to prevent injection attacks and implement rate limiting to protect against abuse and denial-of-service attacks.

## Rationale
Input validation prevents common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, command injection); rate limiting protects service availability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Input validation:
  - All API request parameters, query strings, and body data are validated against expected schemas using DTO validation (e.g., class-validator in NestJS)
  - Invalid input returns HTTP 400 with descriptive error messages (no stack traces or sensitive info)
  - Special characters are properly escaped/sanitized before use in queries or logs
  - File uploads (if any) validate file type, size, and content
- Rate limiting:
  - Global rate limit: configurable requests per minute per IP/client (default: 100 req/min)
  - Endpoint-specific limits for expensive operations (e.g., analytics computation: 20 req/min)
  - Rate limit configuration via environment variables
  - Rate-limited requests return HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` header
  - Rate limit headers included in all responses: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`
- Error handling:
  - Error responses do not leak stack traces, internal paths, or sensitive configuration
  - Generic error messages for unexpected failures; detailed logs for debugging

## Verification
- Unit tests for DTO validation with invalid inputs confirm rejection
- E2E tests verify rate limiting triggers at configured thresholds
- Security tests attempt injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command) and verify sanitization
- Fuzz testing (optional) with malformed inputs

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-020 (logging) for sanitized error logging
- REQ-NF-019 (security baseline)

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Validation rules are defined in DTO classes and kept in sync with OpenAPI schemas
- Rate limiting is in-memory by default; Redis-backed rate limiting for multi-instance deployments is future enhancement

## API/Interface Impact
- 400 responses for validation errors with field-level error details
- 429 responses for rate limit exceeded
- Rate limit headers on all responses

## Observability
- Validation failures logged with: endpoint, validation errors (sanitized), correlation ID
- Rate limit events logged with: client IP/identifier, endpoint, limit exceeded
- Metrics track validation failure rate and rate limit trigger rate

## Risks / Open Questions
- Define rate limit thresholds based on expected usage patterns; document in configuration guide
