## Description
Individual metrics shall be independently testable with mocked LRS data and dependencies, and failures in one metric shall not cascade to others or compromise the core service.

## Rationale
Supports rapid iteration and safe addition of experimental metrics without destabilizing the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each metric can be unit tested in isolation with mocked LRS client and cache.
- Metrics have no direct dependencies on each other; shared logic is extracted to utilities or services.
- If a metric's compute logic throws an exception, the error is caught, logged, and returned as a well-formed error response without crashing the service or affecting other metrics.
- E2E tests can run a single metric without requiring all metrics to be implemented.

## Verification
- Unit tests for representative metrics use mocks for all external dependencies.
- Fault injection tests (e.g., metric throws exception) confirm graceful error handling.
- Code review confirms no inter-metric coupling.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-010 (extension architecture).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Metrics are stateless and side-effect-free beyond logging/metrics emission.

## Observability
- Errors from individual metrics are logged with metric ID and do not obscure root cause.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
