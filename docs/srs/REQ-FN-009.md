## Description
The system shall expose an interactive API documentation UI (e.g., Swagger UI or ReDoc) at a documented route, allowing developers to explore endpoints, view schemas, and execute test requests directly from the browser.

## Rationale
Provides a developer-friendly interface for API exploration and manual testing, reducing onboarding friction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Interactive UI is accessible at a documented route (e.g., `/api-docs` or `/api/v1/docs`).
- UI reflects the current OpenAPI specification (auto-refreshes or is regenerated on deployment).
- Developers can execute sample requests against the running service from the UI (assuming appropriate CORS/auth configuration for dev/staging).
- UI is configurable to be disabled in production via environment variable if desired for security.

## Verification
- Manual testing confirms UI loads and displays all endpoints.
- E2E test navigates to the docs route and verifies presence of key content (endpoint names, schemas).
- Configuration test confirms UI can be toggled on/off via environment.

## Dependencies
- REQ-FN-008 (OpenAPI spec generation).

## Assumptions / Constraints
- Swagger UI or ReDoc is integrated via NestJS Swagger module.
- Default is enabled for dev/staging; configurable for production.

## API/Interface Impact
- Introduces route: GET /api-docs (or similar, documented in README).

## Observability
- Startup logs indicate whether docs UI is enabled.

## Risks / Open Questions
- None.
